## Deployment on Heroku

### Heroku Deployment Steps & Debugging

1. Go to the Heroku Website and create new app
2. Create requirements.txt and Procfile to tell heroku what is required to run the app
3. Login into Heroku Account via command line and add the newly created app
4. Go back to Heroku Website and in the settings tab click *Reveal Config Vars* and add IP and PORT vars from Project Config
5. Install [ClearDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cleardb) and import local MySQL Database dump.sql
5. Restart all dynos
6. Finally do an initial git commit and push to heroku

Note: There are some additional steps and extensive troubleshooting work to successfuly deploy the website to Heroku, which includes:
- integration of whitenoise to allow images to be seen in the Heroku hosting interface 
- using the following commands to create superuser in the Heroku app to understand why no data from json files are showing in the Heroku deployed version
       
       * `$ heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser`
       * `$ git push -f heroku master`
       * `$ heroku run python manage.py migrate`
- manual addition of products into the django database, since there is a bug somehow for preventing data from the json files to be read in the Heroku interface (no such issues with the development version via gitpod IDE; website works well)

Deployed website from Heroku can be found here: https://chi-official.herokuapp.com/
